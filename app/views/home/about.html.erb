<h3>Welcome to MigratoryWords.com</h3> 
 
<p>This website is an evolving proof-of-concept that represents the culminating effort of four graduate students at the University of Californiaâ€™s, School of Information. It was developed over one semester as we explored the interdisciplinary intersection of political, social, information, and computer sciences.</p> 
 
<p>Our problem space focuses on the applied process of investigative research as performed by journalists and others who scrutinize the domain of American public policy and political gamesmanship. Specifically, we emphasize the role of political language and its ability to express flows of intellectual influence.</p> 
 
<p>Currently the system allows any user to query a large index of text documents from multiple knowledge sources to get a broad sense of language&#39;s role in shaping the evolution of policy and to help track the historical shifts in legislative discussion.</p> 
 
<p>For details of our academic study, please <a href="http://migratorywords.com/report/MIMS_FinalProject_MigratoryWords.pdf" target="_blank">review our research</a>.</p> 
 
<h4>Our current Index and its limitations:</h4> 
 
<p>Presently we have nearly 1.3 million documents in our index from government, corporate, and public policy sources. However there are some notable limitations. While some sources have published material for over twenty years, government documents only extend to 1999. Similarly, corporate text includes only 2006, 2007, and a few months between 2009 and 2010. We are working on bridging these gaps. If you have access to textual data that you are licensed to distribute or share your, please contact us at  <a href="mailto:migratorywords@gmail.com" target="_blank">migratorywords@gmail.com</a></p> 
 
<h4>With regard to Fair Use:</h4> 
 
<p>This project applied principles of fair use toward the indexing of publicly distributed works. Our efforts are not-for-profit and we have very specific research motivations. All cached content is displayed in a method similar to Google where we show appropriate context for our users and provide a link back to the original source so the user can explore further. We believe our application is transformative as a contributor to social, political, and professional debate and that it can help citizens to gather greater insight about the expression of political influence in American governance.</p> 
 
<h4>With regard to Intellectual Property:</h4> 
 
<p>This project offers wider distribution of rights-holder content. and while we make attempts to display information accurately, we expect our users to do further research when undertaking any inquiry. If you are a rights holder and wish to have your content removed from our index, please contact us <a href="mailto:migratorywords@gmail.com" target="_blank">migratorywords@gmail.com</a></p>
